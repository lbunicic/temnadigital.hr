              I'm Lovro, a Senior Flutter Engineer at most.io, working on aviation retail and PCI-compliant 
              fintech solutions. With over 7 years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality 
              cross-platform and native mobile applications for enterprise-scale systems.

              Currently at most.io, I'm building Flutter-based payment and retail platforms used by 28,000+ airline crew members across 1,000+ aircrafts, 
              serving 160M+ passengers globally. Our clients include Southwest Airlines, Play, Hawaiian Airlines, and other major carriers.

              My expertise spans Flutter/Dart and the iOS ecosystem—from Flutter widgets to native UIKit and 
              SwiftUI, including advanced frameworks like CoreBluetooth, SceneKit, and RxSwift. I've led 
              projects for major telecom companies, built BLE SDKs for medical devices, and developed secure payment systems.
